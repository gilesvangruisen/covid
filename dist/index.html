        What is <em class="italic">Rt</em>?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
        <em class="italic font-bold">Rt</em> is the real-time effective
        reproduction rate of a virus, in this case COVID-19. The reproduction
        rate tells us the number of secondary infections to expect, on average,
        as a result of a single infected person spreading the virus. In other
        words, <em class="italic font-bold">Rt</em> tells us how quickly the
        virus is spreading at a specific point in time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
        An <em class="italic font-bold">Rt</em> of one or greater means that the
        virus will spread rapidly until a majority of the population has been
        infected. An <em class="italic font-bold">Rt</em> of less than one means
        that the virus will spread more slowly and ultimately disappear before
        it's had the chance to infect everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Understanding and tracking <em class="italic font-bold">Rt</em> at the
        regional and local levels are critical to managing outbreaks of
        COVID-19. Depending on how well we suppress this first wave, we can
        reasonably expect to see continued outbreaks across the country and
        world until a vaccine is developed and rolled out.

        most of my time building data-driven software systems for work and fun.
        I enjoy exploring, analayzing, and visualizing interesting datasets to
        learn more about how the world works.

        With this COVID-19 report, I'm doing my best to ensure the analysis is
        rooted in well-resesarched methods for modeling infectious diseases. I
        am trying to avoid speculative analysis or extrapolation beyond what is
        reasonable given the data available. If you have any questions,
